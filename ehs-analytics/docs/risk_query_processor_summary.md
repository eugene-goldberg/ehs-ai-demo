## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive Risk-Aware Query Processor that seamlessly integrates risk assessment capabilities with the existing EHS Analytics RAG system. The processor enhances query results with risk context, predictive insights, and actionable recommendations.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Main Risk Query Processor
**File**: `/src/ehs_analytics/risk_assessment/risk_query_processor.py`

**Key Features**:
- **RiskAwareQueryProcessor** class for comprehensive risk-aware query processing
- Async processing with concurrent risk assessments for performance
- Intelligent caching system for risk assessments and forecasts
- Integration with existing RAG workflow components

### 2. Enhanced Time Series Module  
**File**: `/src/ehs_analytics/risk_assessment/time_series.py`

**Additions**:
- **TimeSeriesPredictor** class for forecasting capabilities

- Simple trend-based forecasting using statistical methods

## Architecture Integration

### Seamless RAG Integration
The processor integrates at multiple points in the existing workflow:

1. **Query Enhancement**: Enhances `RetrievalResult` objects with risk data
2. **Response Enhancement**: Adds risk context to `GeneratedResponse` objects  
3. **Intent-Based Processing**: Adapts risk analysis based on `QueryClassification`
4. **Entity-Aware**: Uses extracted entities for targeted recommendations

### Processing Pipeline

```
Query → Classification → Retrieval Results → Risk Enhancement → Enhanced Response
                                     ↓
                          Risk Assessment + Forecasting + Recommendations
```

### Error Resilience  
- Graceful degradation on risk assessment failures
- Original data preservation when enhancement fails
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- Health check endpoints for system monitoring

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components
- **Query Router**: Uses `IntentType` and `EntityExtraction` for context-aware processing
- **RAG Agent**: Enhances `RetrievalResult` objects from all 5 retrievers

- **Response Generator**: Extends `GeneratedResponse` with risk context

### LangGraph Workflow Compatibility
- Async processing compatible with LangGraph state management
- Maintains existing message passing patterns
- Preserves workflow tracing and monitoring

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize processor
processor = RiskAwareQueryProcessor(
    risk_analyzers={'electricity': ElectricityRiskAnalyzer()},
    predictor=TimeSeriesPredictor(),
    cache_ttl_minutes=15
)

# Enhance query results
enhanced_results, risk_metadata = await processor.enhance_query_results(
    query="What are the high-risk facilities for electricity consumption?",
    classification=classification_result,
    retrieval_results=rag_results
)

# Generate enhanced response
risk_aware_response = await processor.enhance_response(
    response=original_response,
    enhanced_results=enhanced_results,
    risk_metadata=risk_metadata,
    classification=classification_result
)
```

## Configuration Options

### Risk Context Configuration
```python
risk_context = RiskQueryContext(
    risk_types=[RiskContextType.CURRENT_RISK, RiskContextType.PREDICTIVE_RISK],
    facility_filters=["Plant A", "Plant B"],
    time_horizon_days=30,
    include_forecasts=True,
    anomaly_threshold=0.8,
    filter_level=RiskFilterLevel.HIGH_ONLY
)
```

### Performance Tuning
- `cache_ttl_minutes`: Risk assessment cache lifetime (default: 15)
- `max_concurrent_assessments`: Concurrent processing limit (default: 5)
- `max_forecast_horizon`: Maximum prediction horizon (default: 90 days)

## Benefits
