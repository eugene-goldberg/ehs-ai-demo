Here are the core principles of an advanced agentic RAG system:

Multi-Step, Decomposable Workflows: Unlike a naive RAG that executes a single retrieval task, an agentic system breaks down a complex query into a series of smaller, logical steps or sub-tasks. It orchestrates these tasks within a flexible workflow, allowing it to plan a course of action. For example, answering "What was the total budget of Canada in 2023, and what is that amount plus 3 billion?" would involve a workflow where an agent first retrieves the budget figure and then passes that result to a separate calculator tool for the arithmetic operation.   

Dynamic Tool Use and Specialization: An agentic RAG system is equipped with a diverse set of tools and has the autonomy to decide which one to use for a given sub-task. These tools are not limited to a single retrieval method. They can include:

Semantic vector search for broad queries.   

Graph traversal for precise, multi-hop questions about relationships.   

API callers to fetch real-time data.

Code interpreters or calculators for computations.
This allows the system to choose the best tool for the job, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all retrieval strategy.

Iterative Reasoning and Synthesis: The process is not linear but cyclical. An agent can use the output from one step to inform the next, performing recursive or multi-hop reasoning to build a comprehensive answer. For instance, it might first identify relevant entities in a knowledge graph, then traverse their relationships to gather related context, and finally synthesize insights from multiple retrieved sources into a single, coherent response. This is functionally similar to a Chain of Thought or Tree of Thought process, where external information is used to determine the next step of the investigation.   

Self-Correction and Evaluation: A key characteristic of an advanced agent is the ability to self-reflect and adapt. The system includes an evaluation phase to check if the retrieved information is sufficient or relevant to answer the user's query. If the initial results are inadequate, the agent can autonomously retry the query, reformulate it with additional context, or choose an entirely different tool or strategy to find a better answer. This feedback loop makes the system more resilient and less prone to failure from a single poor retrieval.   

Proactive Query and Context Refinement: An agentic system does not just passively use the user's input. It actively analyzes and enhances the query before retrieval. This can involve augmenting the query with additional context from a knowledge graph, clarifying ambiguous terms, or expanding acronyms to ensure the retrieval step is as precise as possible. This is particularly useful for injecting an organization's specific "worldview" or definitions into the process.   

Structured Knowledge Foundation (GraphRAG): While vector databases are excellent for semantic similarity, advanced agentic systems often rely on a knowledge graph as a structured foundation. A graph explicitly maps the relationships between data points, which is essential for the complex, multi-hop reasoning that agents perform. This structured representation acts as a "world model," allowing the agent to navigate and understand the connections within the data, a task that is difficult with vector search alone.
