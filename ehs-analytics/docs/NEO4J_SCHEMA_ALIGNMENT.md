# Neo4j Schema Alignment Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current Neo4j database schema discovered through database inspection, comparing it with the planned architecture outlined in the EHS Analytics Agent Implementation Plan. The analysis reveals both strengths in the existing data foundation and critical gaps that need to be addressed for successful neo4j-graphrag-python integration.

**Key Findings:**
- Rich entity model with comprehensive utility data tracking (electric bills, water bills, waste manifests)
- Strong foundation for emission calculations and environmental monitoring
- Missing critical entities (Equipment, Permit) that are essential for comprehensive EHS analytics
- Relationship infrastructure exists but needs alignment with planned architecture
- Current data completeness varies significantly across entity types (40%-100%)

  id: string,
  equipment_type: string,
  model: string,
  efficiency_rating: float,
  installation_date: date,
  maintenance_schedule: string,
  power_consumption: float
}

// Critical relationships
(Equipment)-[:LOCATED_AT]->(Facility)
(Equipment)-[:AFFECTS_CONSUMPTION]->(UtilityBill)
(Equipment)-[:REQUIRES_MAINTENANCE]->(MaintenanceSchedule)
```

### 2. Missing Permit Entity (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Impact on Compliance Tracking:**
- Cannot monitor permit expiration dates
- Missing regulatory limit tracking
- No automated compliance violation detection

**Required Implementation:**
```cypher
// Permit node structure needed
Permit {
  id: string,
  permit_type: string,
  limit: float,
  unit: string,
  issued_date: date,
  expiration_date: date,
  regulatory_authority: string
}

// Critical relationships
(Permit)-[:PERMITS]->(Facility)
(Permit)-[:MONITORS_METRIC]->(UtilityBill/WasteManifest)
```

### 3. Incomplete Data Quality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current Data Completeness Issues:**
- **WasteManifest:** 60% complete (missing generator data, hazardous classification)

// Add Equipment entities
CREATE (e:Equipment {
  id: 'equip_cooling_tower_01',
  equipment_type: 'cooling_tower',
  efficiency_rating: 0.85,
  installation_date: '2023-01-15'
})

// Add Permit entities  
CREATE (p:Permit {
  id: 'permit_water_withdrawal_2025',
  permit_type: 'water_withdrawal',
  limit: 50000.0,
  unit: 'gallons_per_day',
  expiration_date: '2025-12-31'
})
```

#### Phase 2: Relationship Enhancement (Week 2-3)
```cypher
// Equipment-Facility relationships
MATCH (e:Equipment), (f:Facility)
CREATE (e)-[:LOCATED_AT]->(f)

// Equipment-Consumption relationships
MATCH (e:Equipment), (b:UtilityBill)
CREATE (e)-[:AFFECTS_CONSUMPTION]->(b)

// Permit-Facility relationships
MATCH (p:Permit), (f:Facility)
CREATE (p)-[:PERMITS]->(f)
```

## Integration Recommendations

### 1. neo4j-graphrag-python Configuration

#### Recommended Retriever Strategy Mapping
```python
retriever_strategy_map = {
    "facility_consumption": "text2cypher",      # Direct facility metrics
    "document_search": "vector",                # Permit/compliance documents  
    "efficiency_analysis": "vector_cypher",     # Equipment-consumption analysis
    "compliance_monitoring": "hybrid_cypher",   # Multi-factor compliance
    "trend_analysis": "hybrid_cypher",          # Time-series with context
    "anomaly_detection": "hybrid_cypher"        # Complex pattern matching
}
```

#### Enhanced Schema Definition for Text2Cypher
```python
ehs_enhanced_schema = """
Node properties:
- Facility: id, name, address, facility_type
- UtilityBill: id, total_kwh, peak_kwh, billing_period_start, billing_period_end, total_cost
- Equipment: id, equipment_type, efficiency_rating, installation_date [TO BE ADDED]
- Permit: id, permit_type, limit, expiration_date [TO BE ADDED]
- WasteManifest: id, manifest_tracking_number, total_weight, issue_date
- Emission: id, amount, unit, calculation_method

Relationships:
- (UtilityBill)-[:BILLED_TO]->(Facility)
- (Equipment)-[:LOCATED_AT]->(Facility) [TO BE ADDED]
- (Equipment)-[:AFFECTS_CONSUMPTION]->(UtilityBill) [TO BE ADDED] 
- (Permit)-[:PERMITS]->(Facility) [TO BE ADDED]
- (UtilityBill)-[:RESULTED_IN]->(Emission)
"""
```

### 2. Performance Optimization Recommendations

#### Index Strategy
```cypher
// Primary entity indexes
CREATE INDEX facility_name_idx FOR (f:Facility) ON (f.name);
CREATE INDEX utility_bill_period_idx FOR (b:UtilityBill) ON (b.billing_period_start);
CREATE INDEX permit_expiration_idx FOR (p:Permit) ON (p.expiration_date);

// Vector search indexes
CREATE VECTOR INDEX document_embeddings 
FOR (d:Document) ON (d.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
  `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
  `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}};
```

#### Query Optimization Patterns
```cypher
// Optimized facility consumption query
MATCH (f:Facility {name: $facility_name})<-[:BILLED_TO]-(b:UtilityBill)
WHERE b.billing_period_start >= $start_date
RETURN f.name, 
       sum(b.total_kwh) as total_consumption,
       avg(b.total_kwh) as average_consumption
ORDER BY b.billing_period_start DESC
```
