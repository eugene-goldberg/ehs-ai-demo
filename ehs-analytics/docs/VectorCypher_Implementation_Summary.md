# VectorCypher Retriever Implementation Summary

## Overview

The VectorCypher Retriever implementation provides relationship-aware vector search for EHS Analytics, combining semantic similarity with graph traversal to find contextually relevant documents through relationships.

## Created Files

### 1. `/src/ehs_analytics/retrieval/strategies/vector_cypher_config.py`

**Purpose**: Configuration management for VectorCypher retrieval strategy

**Key Components**:
- `RelationshipType` enum: Defines 16 types of EHS relationships (LOCATED_AT, COVERS_FACILITY, HAS_INCIDENT, etc.)
- `VectorCypherConfig`: Main configuration class with vector/graph weights, performance settings
- `VectorCypherConfigManager`: Manages query-type specific configurations
- `RelationshipWeight`: Configures weight, decay, and traversal depth per relationship type
- `PathScoringConfig`: Controls path scoring based on relationship types and distances
- `ContextExpansionConfig`: Manages context aggregation from related nodes

**Key Features**:
- Query-type optimized configurations (Equipment Status, Permit Compliance, Incident Analysis, etc.)
- Performance profiles (fast, balanced, comprehensive)
- Relationship priority mappings
- Temporal relationship handling with decay factors

### 2. `/src/ehs_analytics/retrieval/strategies/graph_patterns.py`

**Purpose**: EHS-specific graph traversal patterns and relationship templates

**Key Components**:
- `EHSGraphPatterns`: Predefined patterns for common EHS relationship traversals
- `TraversalPattern`: Template for graph traversal with Cypher queries
- `PathScorer`: Scores graph paths based on relationship weights and context
- `ContextAggregator`: Aggregates content from related nodes with weighting strategies
- `TemporalPatternMatcher`: Handles temporal relationships and event sequences
- `EHSPatternLibrary`: Central library managing all patterns and scoring components

**Predefined Patterns**:
- Equipment-Facility relationships
- Permit-Facility-Equipment chains  
- Incident-Equipment-Facility traversals
- Document context expansion
- Compliance chain tracking
- Temporal event sequences

### 3. `/src/ehs_analytics/retrieval/strategies/vector_cypher_retriever.py`

**Purpose**: Main VectorCypher retriever implementation

**Key Components**:
- `EHSVectorCypherRetriever`: Main retriever class implementing BaseRetriever interface
- `VectorCypherResult`: Result container with vector and relationship scores
- `VectorCypherSearchMetrics`: Performance metrics tracking
- `create_ehs_vector_cypher_retriever()`: Factory function with performance profiles

**Core Functionality**:
1. **Vector Search**: Uses neo4j-graphrag-python's VectorCypherRetriever or fallback manual search
2. **Relationship Expansion**: Traverses graph patterns to find related content
3. **Context Aggregation**: Combines content from related nodes with intelligent weighting
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, parallel processing, configurable limits

**Search Process**:
1. Vector similarity search for semantically similar documents
2. Graph traversal using query-type specific patterns
3. Path scoring and ranking based on relationship weights
4. Context expansion through related entities
5. Final result aggregation with combined vector+relationship scores

### 4. Updated `/src/ehs_analytics/retrieval/strategies/__init__.py`

**Purpose**: Exports all VectorCypher components for easy importing

**New Exports**:
- All VectorCypher classes and configuration objects
- Graph pattern components
- Factory functions and utilities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from ehs_analytics.retrieval.strategies import (
    create_ehs_vector_cypher_retriever,
    QueryType
)

# Create retriever with balanced performance profile
retriever = create_ehs_vector_cypher_retriever(
    neo4j_driver=driver,
    embedding_manager=embedding_manager,
    performance_profile="balanced"
)

# Initialize
await retriever.initialize()

# Search with relationship awareness
result = await retriever.retrieve(
    query="Find all safety incidents related to equipment in facilities with expired permits",
    query_type=QueryType.INCIDENT_ANALYSIS,
    limit=10
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from ehs_analytics.retrieval.strategies import (
    VectorCypherConfig,
    VectorCypherConfigManager,
    RelationshipType,
    RelationshipWeight
)

# Custom configuration
config = VectorCypherConfig(
    vector_weight=0.7,
    graph_weight=0.3,
    max_vector_results=30,
    enable_result_caching=True
)

# Customize relationship weights
config_manager = VectorCypherConfigManager(config)
config_manager.update_relationship_weights({
    RelationshipType.HAS_INCIDENT: RelationshipWeight(
        weight=1.0, 
        decay_factor=0.9, 
        temporal_boost=1.5
    )
})

# Create retriever with custom config
retriever = EHSVectorCypherRetriever(
    neo4j_driver=driver,
    embedding_manager=embedding_manager,
    config=config
)
```

## Key Features

### Relationship-Aware Search
- Combines vector similarity with graph relationship traversal
- Finds contextually relevant documents even if not semantically similar
- Supports multi-hop traversal with configurable depth limits

### EHS-Specific Patterns
- Equipment → Facility relationships
- Permit → Facility → Equipment chains
- Incident → Equipment → Facility traversals
- Document context expansion
- Temporal event sequences

### Performance Optimization
- Three performance profiles: fast, balanced, comprehensive
- Result caching with configurable TTL
- Parallel search execution
- Configurable batch processing

### Query-Type Optimization
- Different configurations for different query types
- Relationship priority weighting per query type
- Temporal importance adjustment
- Facility scope filtering

### Context Expansion
- Intelligent content aggregation from related nodes
- Weighted content selection based on relationship scores
- Temporal weighting for recent content
- Configurable content length limits

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- Implements `BaseRetriever` interface for consistency
- Uses existing `EmbeddingManager` for vector operations
- Integrates with Neo4j driver and existing graph schema
- Compatible with existing query routing and workflow systems

### With GraphRAG Library
- Uses `neo4j-graphrag-python` VectorCypherRetriever when available
- Fallback to manual implementation when GraphRAG unavailable
- Leverages OpenAI embeddings through GraphRAG integration

## Benefits

### Enhanced Query Capabilities
- Enables complex queries like "Find safety incidents at facilities with expired permits"
- Provides context through relationships even for weak semantic matches
- Supports temporal analysis through relationship traversal

### Improved Result Quality
- Combines semantic similarity with relationship relevance
- Provides richer context through related entity information
- Ranks results using both vector and graph signals

### EHS Domain Optimization
- Tailored for EHS data relationships and query patterns
- Optimized for facility, equipment, permit, and incident relationships
- Supports compliance and safety analysis workflows

This implementation provides a powerful foundation for relationship-aware search in the EHS Analytics system, enabling sophisticated queries that leverage both semantic similarity and graph structure to deliver highly relevant results.
