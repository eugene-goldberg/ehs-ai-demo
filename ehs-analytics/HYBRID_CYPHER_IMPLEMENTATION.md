## Supported Query Types

The HybridCypher retriever supports 7 temporal query types:

1. **TREND_ANALYSIS** - Analyzes temporal trends and changes over time
2. **PATTERN_DETECTION** - Detects recurring patterns and cycles
3. **CORRELATION_ANALYSIS** - Analyzes relationships between metrics over time
4. **ANOMALY_DETECTION** - Identifies unusual patterns and outliers
5. **SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS** - Analyzes temporal sequences and event ordering
6. **COMPLIANCE_TIMELINE** - Tracks compliance deadlines and renewal cycles
7. **RISK_PROGRESSION** - Monitors risk escalation and safety evolution

## Example Queries Supported

- "Show emission trends for facilities that had safety incidents in the past 6 months"
- "Find equipment with increasing failure rates near permit renewal dates"
- "Analyze seasonal patterns in water consumption across all facilities"
- "Detect anomalous energy usage spikes in the last quarter"
- "Show correlation between production increases and waste generation over time"
- "Track risk escalation patterns for facilities with multiple violations"

## EHS-Specific Temporal Patterns

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Energy Consumption**: Winter (Dec-Feb) and summer (Jun-Aug) peaks
- **Water Consumption**: Dry season (Jun-Sep) peaks
- **Emissions**: Production cycle variations
- **Incidents**: Weather-related incident patterns

### Compliance Cycles
- **Air Emissions Permits**: 5-year renewal, 12-month reporting, 24-month inspections
- **Water Discharge Permits**: 5-year renewal, 3-month reporting, 12-month inspections
- **Waste Management**: 3-year renewal, 12-month reporting, 18-month inspections
- **Safety Certifications**: 3-year renewal, 6-month reporting, 12-month inspections

### Event Sequences
- **Incident Escalation**: Minor incident → Investigation → Corrective action → Major incident
- **Equipment Degradation**: Efficiency drop → Maintenance alert → Increased emissions → Failure
- **Compliance Violation**: Warning → Inspection → Violation → Enforcement

## Configuration Options

### Performance Profiles
- **SPEED**: Optimized for fast response times
- **ACCURACY**: Optimized for result quality
- **BALANCED**: Balance speed and accuracy
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Maximize temporal analysis depth

### Temporal Decay Functions
- **LINEAR**: Linear decay over time
- **EXPONENTIAL**: Exponential decay with configurable half-life
- **LOGARITHMIC**: Logarithmic decay
- **STEP**: Step function for deadline-based boosting
- **NONE**: No temporal decay

### Factory Configurations
- `create_development_config()` - Development and testing
- `create_production_config()` - Production deployment
- `create_analytics_config()` - Deep analytics workloads
- `create_compliance_config()` - Compliance monitoring
- `create_risk_assessment_config()` - Risk assessment queries

## Integration

The HybridCypher retriever is fully integrated into the EHS Analytics retrieval system:

- Added to `__init__.py` with all exports
- Compatible with existing `BaseRetriever` interface
- Uses established `RetrievalResult` and `RetrievalMetadata` structures
- Integrates with existing vector and text2cypher retrievers
- Supports standard health checks and cleanup operations

## Technical Implementation

- **Async/await** support for all operations
- **Neo4j GraphRAG** integration for hybrid search capabilities
- **OpenAI embeddings** for vector similarity
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging
- **Performance metrics** tracking and optimization
- **Memory and CPU resource** management
- **Configurable timeouts** and parallel execution

## Next Steps for Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure Neo4j driver with EHS data schema
2. **Embeddings**: Set up OpenAI embeddings for vector search
3. **Initialize**: Create HybridCypher retriever with appropriate configuration
4. **Testing**: Test with sample temporal queries
5. **Tuning**: Optimize configuration based on performance metrics

The implementation provides a robust foundation for complex temporal analytics in EHS data, supporting sophisticated queries that combine multiple data sources and analysis methods with temporal awareness.
