## Conclusion

The waste manifest data extraction and storage system demonstrates core functionality with successful entity creation and relationship establishment. However, significant data quality improvements are required for full regulatory compliance and operational effectiveness.

The most critical gap is the absence of generator information, which is mandatory for waste manifest compliance. Additionally, the incomplete manifest properties and minimal transporter data limit the system's utility for comprehensive waste tracking and reporting.

The emission calculation component performs excellently, providing accurate CO2 equivalent calculations based on disposal methods. This foundation supports the environmental impact tracking requirements of the EHS AI platform.

**Next Steps**: Immediate focus should be on data completeness improvements, particularly generator entity creation and manifest property population, followed by establishment of complete business relationship mappings in the knowledge graph.
