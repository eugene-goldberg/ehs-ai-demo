> Document Version: 1.0
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning Phase

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the strategy for generating 6 months of realistic historical EHS (Environmental, Health & Safety) data for the AI demo system. The generated data will simulate authentic operational patterns, seasonal variations, and realistic correlations between different environmental metrics to enable meaningful trend analysis and AI model training.

### Key Objectives
- Generate realistic EHS data spanning 6 months (March 2024 - August 2024)
- Ensure data authenticity with proper correlations and variations
- Enable comprehensive trend analysis and pattern recognition
- Support AI model training with quality baseline data
- Integrate seamlessly with existing facility and document structures

## Data Generation Strategy

### 1. Core Metrics Overview

#### Electricity Consumption
- **Range**: 850-1,200 kWh/day per facility
- **Base Load**: 900 kWh/day (continuous operations)
- **Peak Variations**: +/- 25% based on operational intensity
- **Seasonal Factors**: +15% summer (cooling), +10% winter (heating)

#### Water Usage
- **Range**: 2,500-4,000 gallons/day per facility
- **Base Consumption**: 3,000 gallons/day
- **Weather Correlation**: +30% during hot/dry periods
- **Production Correlation**: Direct linear relationship (0.8 correlation coefficient)

#### Waste Generation
- **Total Waste**: 1,200-2,000 lbs/day per facility
- **Recycling Rate**: 65-75% (target 70%)
- **Hazardous Waste**: 50-150 lbs/day
- **Diversion Rate**: 85-92% (target 90%)

### 2. Temporal Patterns and Algorithms

#### Daily Patterns
```python
# Electricity consumption daily pattern
def daily_electricity_pattern(hour):
    base_load = 0.75  # 75% of peak during off-hours
    if 6 <= hour <= 18:  # Business hours
        return 1.0 + 0.3 * sin((hour - 6) * pi / 12)
    else:
        return base_load + 0.1 * random.normal(0, 0.05)

# Water usage patterns
def daily_water_pattern(hour, temperature, production_level):
    base_usage = 1.0
    operational_factor = 1.5 if 7 <= hour <= 17 else 0.6
    temp_factor = 1 + (temperature - 70) * 0.02  # 2% increase per degree above 70F
    production_factor = 0.5 + (production_level * 0.5)
    return base_usage * operational_factor * temp_factor * production_factor
```

#### Weekly Patterns
- **Monday-Friday**: 100% operational intensity
- **Saturday**: 60% operational intensity
- **Sunday**: 30% operational intensity (maintenance, security)

#### Seasonal Variations
```python
def seasonal_multiplier(month):
    seasonal_factors = {
        3: 0.95,   # March - moderate
        4: 1.0,    # April - baseline
        5: 1.05,   # May - increased activity
        6: 1.15,   # June - summer peak
        7: 1.2,    # July - maximum consumption
        8: 1.1     # August - slight decrease
    }
    return seasonal_factors.get(month, 1.0)
```

### 3. Facility-Specific Patterns

#### Manufacturing Facilities (Denver, Phoenix)
- **Production Correlation**: Strong correlation with electricity and water
- **Waste Profile**: 40% recyclable materials, 15% hazardous
- **Peak Hours**: 6 AM - 6 PM operational cycles

#### Office Facilities (Austin, Seattle)
- **HVAC Dominance**: 60% of electricity for climate control
- **Water Usage**: Primarily domestic, lower correlation with weather
- **Waste Profile**: 80% recyclable materials, 2% hazardous

### 4. Data Quality and Validation

#### Validation Rules
```python
# Data consistency checks
def validate_electricity_data(value, facility_type, hour, month):
    expected_range = get_expected_range(facility_type, hour, month)
    if not (expected_range.min <= value <= expected_range.max):
        return ValidationError("Value outside expected range")
    return ValidationSuccess()

# Correlation validation
def validate_correlations(electricity, water, temperature, production):
    expected_corr = 0.75  # Expected correlation between water and production
    actual_corr = correlation(water, production)
    if abs(actual_corr - expected_corr) > 0.15:
        return ValidationWarning("Correlation outside expected bounds")
```

#### Quality Assurance Metrics
- **Completeness**: >99.5% data availability
- **Accuracy**: Values within 3 standard deviations
- **Consistency**: Cross-metric correlations within expected ranges
- **Timeliness**: All timestamps properly sequenced
