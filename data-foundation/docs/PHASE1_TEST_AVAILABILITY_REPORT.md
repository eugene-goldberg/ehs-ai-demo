- **Pro-Rating**: `/api/v1/prorating/process/{id}`
- **Rejection Tracking**: `/api/v1/documents/{id}/reject`

## 9. Conclusion

The EHS AI Demo system has a robust testing infrastructure with comprehensive coverage for the core extraction APIs. However, **Phase 1 features lack dedicated test coverage**, representing a significant gap that must be addressed before production deployment.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Strong foundation**: Excellent API testing framework with 831 lines of comprehensive tests
- ⚠️ **Coverage gap**: Zero test coverage for Phase 1 specific features
- ✅ **Infrastructure ready**: pytest, coverage reporting, and test runners are properly configured
- ❌ **Integration missing**: No end-to-end tests for Phase 1 workflows

### Immediate Action Required:
1. Develop Phase 1 feature test suites (estimated 40-60 hours)
2. Create test fixtures and mock data for new features
3. Implement integration tests for Phase 1 workflows
4. Add performance testing for batch operations

The existing test infrastructure provides an excellent foundation for expanding test coverage to include Phase 1 features, but dedicated development effort is required to achieve comprehensive coverage before production deployment.
