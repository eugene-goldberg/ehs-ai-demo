## Key Enhancements & Business Value

We are implementing three core enhancements that deliver substantial business value and direct user benefits:

### 1. Enhanced Data Auditability & Source Document Tracking

*   **Business Value:** Users can now trace every piece of data back to its original source document, dramatically improving trust, ensuring compliance, and significantly reducing manual verification efforts. This builds confidence in our data's integrity.
*   **Feature Description:** Every processed document will maintain a direct, easily accessible link to its original file. This means you can click on any data point in the system and instantly view the source document it came from, providing complete transparency and verification at your fingertips.

### 2. Improved Financial Accuracy & Smart Bill Allocation

*   **Business Value:** Utility bills spanning multiple months are now accurately allocated to their precise calendar months, providing precise monthly cost reporting and eliminating the need for time-consuming manual adjustments. This leads to more reliable financial insights.
*   **Feature Description:** Our system will intelligently identify utility bills that cover periods crossing multiple calendar months. It will then automatically and proportionally split the costs across the relevant months, ensuring that your monthly financial reports reflect true, day-level accurate costs for each specific month.

### 3. Better Data Quality Management & Document Quality Control

*   **Business Value:** Invalid or irrelevant documents can now be properly tracked, managed, and separated from our core dataset. This ensures our data remains clean, reliable, and free from noise, leading to higher quality analysis and reporting.
*   **Feature Description:** We're introducing a robust system to identify and manage documents that are either not relevant or not usable for data extraction. This includes a clean interface that clearly separates valid, processed documents from those that have been rejected or flagged, allowing for better oversight and a consistently high-quality dataset.

## User Experience Improvements

Users will experience direct and tangible improvements in their daily interactions:

*   **Instant Data Verification:** Users can click on any data point within reports or dashboards to immediately view the original source document, eliminating guesswork and manual file searches.
*   **Accurate Monthly Financials:** Monthly reports will now display precise costs, accurately allocated to each specific month, providing a clearer financial picture without the need for manual adjustments.
*   **Streamlined Document Management:** A clean and intuitive interface will clearly distinguish between valid, processed documents and those that require attention or have been rejected, simplifying data oversight.
*   **Transparent Audit Trails:** A clear and comprehensive audit trail will show who made decisions regarding document validity and when, enhancing accountability and compliance.
