        "average_cost": 5009.06
      },
      "summer": {
        "average_amount": 70302.75,
        "average_cost": 6022.34
      }
    },
    "anomalies": {
      "2025-08": {
        "amount": "The consumption increased by only 3.29% compared to the previous month's 16.96% increase",
        "cost": "The cost decreased by 3.59% despite the increase in consumption"
      }
    },
    "key_observations": {
      "consumption_patterns": "The electricity consumption has been consistently increasing over the past 6 months. The rate of increase is also growing, except for August 2025 where it slowed down significantly. The cost, however, does not follow the same pattern, with a decrease observed in August 2025 despite the increase in consumption.",
      "impact_on_annual_goals": "If the current trend continues, the annual electricity consumption will exceed the expected amount. The cost, however, may not follow the same trend due to fluctuations observed in the data."
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Risk Assessment

**Prompt:**
> You are an expert EHS analyst comparing consumption trends to reduction goals. Respond in JSON format with projected performance calculations.
> 
> Based on the trend analysis below, assess the risk of missing the annual goal:
> - Annual Goal: 15.0 tonnes CO2e
> - Current Performance: 0.0 tonnes CO2e (9 months)
> - Months Remaining: 3
> 
> Calculate the projected annual performance and assign a risk level:
> 
> Risk Levels:
> - LOW: >90% chance of meeting goal (projected performance within 10% of goal)
> - MEDIUM: 50-90% chance of meeting goal (projected performance 10-25% from goal)
> - HIGH: 10-50% chance of meeting goal (projected performance 25-50% from goal)
> - CRITICAL: <10% chance of meeting goal (projected performance >50% from goal)

**Agent Response:**

```json
{
  "projected_annual_performance": {
    "projected_annual_consumption": "Based on the current trend, the projected annual consumption is expected to exceed the annual goal. However, without specific consumption data, an exact projection cannot be calculated.",
    "gap_analysis": "The gap analysis indicates a risk of not meeting the annual goal. The exact gap cannot be determined without specific consumption data.",
    "risk_level_assignment": {
      "risk_level": "HIGH",
      "justification": "The risk level is assigned as HIGH due to the consistent increase in consumption over the past 6 months. If the current trend continues, the annual electricity consumption will exceed the expected amount. However, the exact risk percentage cannot be calculated without specific consumption data."
    },
    "key_risk_factors": {
      "increasing_consumption": "The electricity consumption has been consistently increasing over the past 6 months. The rate of increase is also growing, except for August 2025 where it slowed down significantly.",
      "cost_fluctuations": "The cost does not follow the same pattern as consumption, with a decrease observed in August 2025 despite the increase in consumption. This could impact the ability to meet the annual goal.",
      "seasonal_patterns": "The average consumption in summer is significantly higher than in spring. This could impact the ability to meet the annual goal if the trend continues."
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Recommendations Generation

**Prompt:**
> Generate 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations for Site (Manufacturing) to address electricity consumption concerns.
> 
> Context:
> - Risk Level: MEDIUM
> - Goal Gap: 0% units
> - Key Risk Factors: Risk level: MEDIUM
> - Months Remaining: 3
> 
> For each recommendation, provide:
> 1. Priority Level (High/Medium/Low)
> 2. Specific Action Description
> 3. Estimated Monthly Impact (units reduction/improvement)
> 4. Implementation Effort (Low/Medium/High)
> 5. Timeline (Immediate/Short-term/Long-term)
> 6. Resource Requirements

**Agent Response:**

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "priorityLevel": "High",
      "actionDescription": "Implement a real-time energy monitoring system to identify inefficiencies and areas of high energy consumption.",

   - June: +13.91% increase
   - July: +16.96% increase
   - August: +3.29% increase (anomaly - significant slowdown)

2. **Risk Assessment**: HIGH risk level assigned
   - Projected to exceed annual CO2 reduction goal of 15 tonnes
   - Consistent increasing consumption pattern
   - Seasonal variations with summer consumption 52% higher than spring

3. **Key Recommendations**:
   - Implement real-time energy monitoring (10% potential reduction)
   - Regular machinery maintenance (5% potential reduction)
   - Staff training on conservation (5% potential reduction)
   - Energy-efficient equipment upgrades (3% potential reduction)
   - Waste reduction program (2% potential reduction)
