# Risk Assessment Agent Transcript

## Recommendation Generation Prompt

Generate 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations for Site (Manufacturing) to address consumption consumption concerns.

### Context:
- Risk Level: CRITICAL
- Goal Gap: 1011.35% units
- Key Risk Factors: Risk level: CRITICAL
- Months Remaining: 3

### INDUSTRIAL BEST PRACTICES TO CONSIDER:

#### 1. Energy Efficiency Measures
- Advanced lighting systems (LED upgrades, smart controls)
- Building envelope optimization (insulation, windows, HVAC systems)
- Equipment modernization and right-sizing
- Real-time energy monitoring and management systems
- **Example:** General Motors achieved 35% energy reduction across facilities through comprehensive efficiency programs

#### 2. Process Electrification
- Converting combustion-based processes to electric alternatives
- Electric heating systems, induction heating, electric ovens
- Electric vehicle fleet conversion
- Heat pump installations for heating and cooling
- **Example:** Cleveland-Cliffs implemented electric arc furnace technology, reducing CO2 emissions by 75% compared to traditional blast furnaces

#### 3. Renewable Energy Procurement
- On-site solar and wind installations
- Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy providers
- Virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs)
- Battery energy storage systems integration
- **Example:** RMS Company achieved 100% renewable electricity through a combination of on-site solar and renewable energy contracts

#### 4. Fuel Switching
- Natural gas to renewable natural gas conversion
- Hydrogen adoption for high-temperature processes
- Biofuels for transportation and heating
- Electric alternatives to fossil fuel equipment
- **Example:** ArcelorMittal is piloting hydrogen-based steelmaking to replace coal-fired processes

#### 5. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)
- Direct air capture systems
- Point-source carbon capture on industrial processes
- Carbon utilization in manufacturing processes
- Partnerships with carbon storage providers
- **Example:** Microsoft has committed to removing all historical CO2 emissions through CCUS technologies and nature-based solutions

### CITATION REQUIREMENTS:

When generating recommendations, you MUST:
- Reference specific best practices from the list above when applicable
- Include citations to real company examples when making recommendations
- Specify which industrial best practice category each recommendation falls under
- Provide evidence-based justification for proposed solutions

For each recommendation, provide:
1. Priority Level (High/Medium/Low)
2. Specific Action Description
3. Best Practice Category (from the 5 categories above)
4. Estimated Monthly Impact (units reduction/improvement)
5. Implementation Effort (Low/Medium/High)
6. Timeline (Immediate/Short-term/Long-term)
7. Resource Requirements
8. Supporting Evidence/Citation (reference to best practice or company example)

### Focus Areas by Risk Level:
- **LOW**: Optimization and efficiency improvements (focus on Energy Efficiency Measures)
- **MEDIUM**: Targeted interventions and monitoring (combine Energy Efficiency with Process Electrification)
- **HIGH**: Aggressive conservation measures and system changes (incorporate Renewable Energy Procurement and Fuel Switching)
- **CRITICAL**: Emergency protocols and immediate action plans (consider all best practices including CCUS for long-term strategy)

### Ensure recommendations are:
- Specific to the site type and consumption category
- Quantifiable where possible
- Realistic and implementable
- Aligned with industry best practices and supported by real-world examples
- Include specific citations to best practices or company examples
