# EHS Extraction API Implementation Summary

## Overview

The EHS (Environmental, Health, Safety) Extraction API is a FastAPI-based REST service that provides programmatic access to EHS data stored in a Neo4j graph database. The API leverages a LangGraph-based workflow system to execute complex queries, analyze results using LLM capabilities, and generate structured reports in multiple formats.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main layers:
1. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints with request/response validation
2. **Workflow Layer**: LangGraph-based data extraction orchestration
3. **Data Layer**: Neo4j graph database with EHS domain models

```
FastAPI REST API → DataExtractionWorkflow → Neo4j Database
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Validation         LLM Analysis          Graph Queries
   Response           Report Generation     Data Retrieval
```
