      "1": "The query was executed successfully without any errors.",

      "3": "Despite the successful execution, the query did not return any records."

    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There are no patterns or trends to report as the query did not return any data."
    },
    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The lack of returned data could indicate that there are no transporters in the database that match the query parameters.",
      "2": "Alternatively, it could suggest that there are issues with the data quality or structure in the database, such as missing or incorrectly formatted data."
    },
    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Verify the existence of transporter data in the database.",
      "2": "Check the structure and quality of the data in the database to ensure it matches the query parameters.",
      "3": "If the data is confirmed to be correct and the query is still returning no results, consider revising the query parameters."
