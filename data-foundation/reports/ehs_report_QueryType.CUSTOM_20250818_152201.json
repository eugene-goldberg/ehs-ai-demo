      "1": "The query executed was a custom type and it was successful.",

      "3": "Despite the successful execution of the query, no records were retrieved."
    },
    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There are no patterns or trends to report as no data was retrieved from the query."
    },
    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The main data quality issue is the lack of data. Despite the successful execution of the query, no records were retrieved.",
      "2": "This could indicate that there are no disposal facilities in the database, or that the data about these facilities is stored under different parameters than those used in the query."
    },
    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Check the database to ensure that data about disposal facilities is being correctly stored and categorized.",
      "2": "If the data is present, adjust the parameters of the query to match the way the data is stored in the database.",
      "3": "If the data is not present, consider ways to collect and incorporate this data into the database for future queries."
