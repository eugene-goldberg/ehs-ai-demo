      "1": "The query executed successfully without any errors.",

      "3": "Despite the successful execution, the query did not retrieve any records."

    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "No patterns or trends can be identified from the data as no records were retrieved from the query."
    },
    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The lack of retrieved records could indicate a data quality issue. It's possible that the database does not contain any data related to emissions, or the data might not be properly labeled or categorized.",
      "2": "Another potential issue could be that the query parameters are too specific or restrictive, resulting in no matching records."
    },
    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Check the database to ensure that it contains data related to emissions and that the data is properly labeled and categorized.",
      "2": "Review the query parameters to ensure they are not too specific or restrictive. If necessary, adjust the parameters to retrieve a broader range of records.",
      "3": "If the database does not contain any data related to emissions, consider collecting this data if it is relevant to your EHS objectives."
