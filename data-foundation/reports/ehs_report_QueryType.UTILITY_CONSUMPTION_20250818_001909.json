    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There is no discernible pattern or trend from the data provided as it pertains to a single billing period."

      "1": "The first query did not return any results. This could indicate a data quality issue, such as missing or incorrectly formatted utility bill documents.",

      "1": "Investigate why the first query did not return any results. Check the format and availability of utility bill documents in the database.",
