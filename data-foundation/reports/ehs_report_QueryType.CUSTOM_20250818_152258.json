      "1": "No patterns or trends can be identified as no data was retrieved from the query."

    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The lack of returned data could indicate a potential data quality issue. It could be due to the absence of matching records in the database, or it could be a result of an incorrect or overly specific query.",
      "2": "The query might not be returning any results due to missing or incorrect data in the 'WasteManifest' or 'Transporter' nodes."

    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Review the query to ensure it is correctly structured and targeting the right nodes and relationships.",
      "2": "Check the database to ensure the 'WasteManifest' and 'Transporter' nodes contain the necessary data.",
      "3": "If the query is correct and the nodes contain data, consider broadening the query parameters to return a larger set of results."
