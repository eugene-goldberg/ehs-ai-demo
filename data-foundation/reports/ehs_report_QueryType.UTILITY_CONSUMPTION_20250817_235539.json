      "1": "Two queries were executed successfully.",
      "2": "The first query, which was intended to extract utility bill documents, did not return any results.",
      "3": "The second query, which was intended to calculate total consumption, average cost, and bill count for the specified period, returned one record.",
      "4": "The total consumption for the period from June 1, 2025, to June 30, 2025, was 260,000 kWh.",
      "5": "The average cost for the same period was $15,432.89.",
      "6": "The number of bills for the same period was 2."

    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There is no clear pattern or trend that can be observed from the given data as it pertains to a single period of time."

    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The first query did not return any results. This could indicate a data quality issue, such as missing or incorrectly formatted data.",
      "2": "The second query returned only one record, which could suggest a lack of data for the specified period."
    },
    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Investigate why the first query did not return any results. Check the data for completeness and correct formatting.",
      "2": "Consider running the second query for different periods to gather more data and identify any patterns or trends in utility consumption and cost.",
      "3": "Ensure that all utility bills are being correctly recorded and stored in the database."
