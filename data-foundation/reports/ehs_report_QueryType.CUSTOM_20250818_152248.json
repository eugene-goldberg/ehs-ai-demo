    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The absence of any records could indicate a potential data quality issue. It could be due to the lack of data in the database or the specific criteria of the query not being met.",

      "1": "Check the database to ensure that it contains the necessary data for the query.",
      "2": "Review the query to ensure that it is correctly formulated and targets the right data.",
      "3": "If the data is expected to be sparse, consider adjusting the query or data collection methods to gather more comprehensive data."
