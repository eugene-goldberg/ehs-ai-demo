    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "No patterns or trends can be identified from the data as no records were retrieved from the query."
    },
    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The lack of returned records could indicate that there are no WasteManifest nodes in the database, or that these nodes are not connected to any other nodes.",
      "2": "It could also be possible that the query parameters are not correctly set, leading to no matches found."

    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Check the database to ensure that WasteManifest nodes exist and are connected to other nodes.",
      "2": "Review the query parameters to ensure they are correctly set to match the desired nodes and relationships.",
      "3": "If the database and query parameters are correct, consider revising the query to ensure it is correctly structured to return the desired results."
