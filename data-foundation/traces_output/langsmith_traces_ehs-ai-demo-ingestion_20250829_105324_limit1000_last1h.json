Environmental Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include emissions, waste management, and water usage. \n\n2. Health Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include exposure to hazardous substances, occupational diseases, and workplace injuries.\n\n3. Safety Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n\n4. Compliance Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n\n5. Facility Information: No data provided. The type of facility, its location, and the nature of its operations could all influence the potential risk factors.\n\n6. Assessment Scope: The assessment was intended to cover environmental, health, safety, and compliance categories over a three-month period from May to August 2025.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, it is recommended that additional data collection is undertaken. This should include:\n\n- Detailed environmental data, including emissions levels, waste produced, and water usage.\n- Detailed health data, including records of exposure levels, safety incidents, and occupational hazards.\n- Detailed safety data, including records of equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n- Detailed compliance data, including records of permit violations and instances of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThis additional data will allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment to be conducted.",

Environmental Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include emissions, waste management, and water usage. \n\n2. Health Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include exposure to hazardous substances, occupational diseases, and workplace injuries.\n\n3. Safety Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n\n4. Compliance Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n\n5. Facility Information: No data provided. The type of facility, its location, and the nature of its operations could all influence the potential risk factors.\n\n6. Assessment Scope: The assessment was intended to cover environmental, health, safety, and compliance categories over a three-month period from May to August 2025.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, it is recommended that additional data collection is undertaken.

Therefore, it is not possible to identify any specific risk factors based on the current dataset.\n\nHowever, here is a summary of the data reviewed and some general risk factors that could be considered for this type of facility:\n\n1. Environmental Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include emissions, waste management, and water usage. \n\n2. Health Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include exposure to hazardous substances, occupational diseases, and workplace injuries.\n\n3. Safety Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n\n4. Compliance Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n\n5. Facility Information: No data provided. The type of facility, its location, and the nature of its operations could all influence the potential risk factors.\n\n6. Assessment Scope: The assessment was intended to cover environmental, health, safety, and compliance categories over a three-month period from May to August 2025.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, it is recommended that additional data collection is undertaken. This should include:\n\n- Detailed environmental data, including emissions levels, waste produced, and water usage.\n- Detailed health data, including records of exposure levels, safety incidents, and occupational hazards.\n- Detailed safety data, including records of equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n- Detailed compliance data, including records of permit violations and instances of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThis additional data will allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment to be conducted.",

Environmental Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include emissions, waste management, and water usage. \n\n2. Health Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include exposure to hazardous substances, occupational diseases, and workplace injuries.\n\n3. Safety Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n\n4. Compliance Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n\n5. Facility Information: No data provided. The type of facility, its location, and the nature of its operations could all influence the potential risk factors.\n\n6. Assessment Scope: The assessment was intended to cover environmental, health, safety, and compliance categories over a three-month period from May to August 2025.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, it is recommended that additional data collection is undertaken. This should include:\n\n- Detailed environmental data, including emissions levels, waste produced, and water usage.\n- Detailed health data, including records of exposure levels, safety incidents, and occupational hazards.\n- Detailed safety data, including records of equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n- Detailed compliance data, including records of permit violations and instances of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThis additional data will allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment to be conducted.",

Environmental Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include emissions, waste management, and water usage. \n\n2. Health Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include exposure to hazardous substances, occupational diseases, and workplace injuries.\n\n3. Safety Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n\n4. Compliance Data: No data provided. Typical risks in this category could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n\n5. Facility Information: No data provided. The type of facility, its location, and the nature of its operations could all influence the potential risk factors.\n\n6. Assessment Scope: The assessment was intended to cover environmental, health, safety, and compliance categories over a three-month period from May to August 2025.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, it is recommended that additional data collection is undertaken. This should include:\n\n- Detailed environmental data, including emissions levels, waste produced, and water usage.\n- Detailed health data, including records of exposure levels, safety incidents, and occupational hazards.\n- Detailed safety data, including records of equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n- Detailed compliance data, including records of permit violations and instances of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThis additional data will allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment to be conducted.",

Therefore, it is not possible to identify any specific risk factors at this time. \n\nHowever, here is a general analysis based on typical risk factors for facilities:\n\n1. Environmental Risks:\n   - Description: Potential risks could include emissions, waste production, and excessive water usage.\n   - Severity and Probability: Without specific data, it's difficult to assess. However, these risks are typically high in severity due to potential environmental damage and regulatory penalties.\n   - Supporting Data Points: No data provided.\n   - Category Classification: Environmental Risk\n\n2. Health Risks:\n   - Description: Potential risks could include exposure to hazardous substances, safety incidents, and occupational hazards.\n   - Severity and Probability: Without specific data, it's difficult to assess. However, these risks are typically high in severity due to potential harm to employees and associated legal implications.\n   - Supporting Data Points: No data provided.\n   - Category Classification: Health Risk\n\n3. Safety Risks:\n   - Description: Potential risks could include equipment failures, process deviations, and near misses.\n   - Severity and Probability: Without specific data, it's difficult to assess. However, these risks are typically high in severity due to potential harm to employees and damage to equipment.\n   - Supporting Data Points: No data provided.\n   - Category Classification: Safety Risk\n\n4. Compliance Risks:\n   - Description: Potential risks could include permit violations and regulatory non-compliance.\n   - Severity and Probability: Without specific data, it's difficult to assess. However, these risks are typically high in severity due to potential legal penalties and damage to the company's reputation.\n   - Supporting Data Points: No data provided.\n   - Category Classification: Compliance Risk\n\nData Completeness: The data provided is not complete. There is no specific information available for environmental, health, safety, and compliance data.\n\nRecommendations for Additional Data Collection: To conduct a comprehensive EHS risk analysis, it is recommended to collect data on emissions, waste production, water usage, exposure levels, safety incidents, occupational hazards, equipment conditions, process deviations, permit status, and regulatory compliance.",
