    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There is no discernible pattern or trend from the data provided as it pertains to a single billing period."

    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The first query did not return any results, which could indicate a data quality issue. It is possible that the utility bill documents for the specified period are missing or not properly linked in the database.",
      "2": "The second query returned only one record, which could indicate a lack of data for the specified period. This could be due to missing data, or it could be that there was only one utility bill for that period."

    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Investigate why the first query did not return any results. Check the database for missing or improperly linked utility bill documents.",
      "2": "If the lack of data for the specified period is due to missing data, efforts should be made to collect and input the missing data.",
      "3": "If there was only one utility bill for the specified period, consider whether this is expected or if it indicates an issue that needs to be addressed."
