      "3": "No records were retrieved from the first three queries.",
      "4": "The fourth query returned a record indicating zero total water usage, no average cost, and zero bill count for the specified period."
    },
    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "There is no water consumption recorded for the specified period.",
      "2": "There is no billing activity recorded for the specified period."
    },
    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The lack of data retrieved from the queries could indicate a data quality issue. It's possible that the data for the specified period is missing or not yet recorded in the database.",
      "2": "The null value for average cost in the fourth query's result could also indicate a data quality issue. It's possible that cost data is not being properly recorded or processed."
    },
    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Investigate the potential data quality issues identified. Check if the data for the specified period is indeed missing or not yet recorded in the database.",
      "2": "Review the data recording and processing procedures for cost data to ensure they are functioning correctly.",
      "3": "If the data is confirmed to be missing, take steps to recover it if possible. If the data is not yet recorded, ensure that the data recording process is completed as soon as possible."
