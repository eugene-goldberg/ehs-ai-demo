      "1": "A total of 8 queries were executed, out of which only 2 were successful.",
      "2": "No records were retrieved from the executed queries.",
      "3": "The successful query did not return any results.",
      "4": "The failed queries were due to missing parameters, specifically 'start_date' and 'end_date'."

    "Patterns or Trends": {
      "1": "The queries are designed to extract information about waste generation, transportation, and disposal.",
      "2": "The queries are structured to retrieve data about waste shipments, waste generators, transporters, disposal facilities, waste items, and emissions.",
      "3": "The queries are sorted by shipment date and total waste quantity."

    "Potential Data Quality Issues": {
      "1": "The main issue is the lack of required parameters in some queries, which led to their failure.",
      "2": "The successful query did not return any data, which could indicate a lack of data in the database or an issue with the query itself.",
      "3": "The absence of data makes it impossible to assess the quality of the data."

    "Recommendations": {
      "1": "Ensure that all required parameters are provided when executing queries.",
      "2": "Check the successful query to ensure it is correctly structured and that the database contains the required data.",
      "3": "Consider implementing data validation checks to prevent the execution of queries with missing parameters."
