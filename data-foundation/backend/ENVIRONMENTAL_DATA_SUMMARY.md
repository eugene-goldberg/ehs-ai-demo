# Environmental Data Load Summary

**Created:** 2025-08-31  
**Script:** `/scripts/load_site_environmental_data.py`  
**Verification:** `/verify_environmental_data.py`

## Overview

Successfully generated and loaded 6 months (March-August 2025) of comprehensive environmental data for two manufacturing sites with specific risk-triggering patterns designed for LLM assessment and analysis.

## Sites Created

### 1. Algonquin Manufacturing (Algonquin, IL) - **HIGH RISK**
- **Facility Type:** Manufacturing
- **Employees:** 245
- **Operating Hours:** 16 hours/day (2 shifts)
- **Risk Profile:** HIGH

### 2. Houston Processing Center (Houston, TX) - **MEDIUM RISK**
- **Facility Type:** Processing
- **Employees:** 380
- **Operating Hours:** 24 hours/day (3 shifts)
- **Risk Profile:** MEDIUM

## Risk Patterns Implemented

### Electricity Consumption (High Risk Indicators)
- **Algonquin IL:** 
  - Baseline: 45,000 kWh/month → Trending **UP 7.2%** over 6 months
  - **TARGET:** 15% REDUCTION (missed by 22+ percentage points)
  - March: 1,129 kWh/day → August: 1,210 kWh/day
  
- **Houston TX:**
  - Baseline: 65,000 kWh/month → Trending **UP 29.1%** over 6 months
  - **TARGET:** 18% REDUCTION (missed by 47+ percentage points)
  - March: 1,518 kWh/day → August: 1,960 kWh/day

### Water Consumption (Summer Spikes)
- **Algonquin IL:** 21.1% summer spike (4,301 → 5,210 gallons/day)
- **Houston TX:** 31.3% summer spike (5,792 → 7,605 gallons/day)

### Waste Management & Recycling Performance
- **Algonquin IL:** STAGNANT at 25% recycling rate (TARGET: 50%)
  - **Gap to Target:** 25 percentage points BELOW target
  
- **Houston TX:** IMPROVING from 30.1% → 39.7% recycling rate (TARGET: 50%)
  - **Gap to Target:** 15 percentage points BELOW target
  - Shows positive trend but still underperforming

## Data Completeness

| Data Type | Records per Site | Total Records |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Sites | 2 sites | 2 |
| Electricity Consumption | 184 daily records | 368 |
| Water Consumption | 184 daily records | 368 |
| Waste Generation | 104 weekly records | 208 |
| Environmental Targets | 3 targets each | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | | **952 records** |

## LLM Analysis Features

### 1. **Realistic Daily Variations**
- Weekday vs weekend patterns (70% reduction on weekends)
- Seasonal weather impacts (cooling/heating loads)
- Random daily variations (±10-15%)

### 2. **Equipment and Operational Metadata**
- **Algonquin IL Issues:**
  - "HVAC system running inefficiently - requires maintenance"
  - "Machine shop equipment running extended hours due to backlog"
  - "Lighting system upgrade delayed - old fluorescents still in use"
  
- **Houston TX Improvements:**
  - "New recycling education program showing results"
  - "Partnership with local recycling facility expanding"
  - "Improved sorting stations installed in break areas"

### 3. **Performance Targets & Gap Analysis**
- Clear sustainability targets with measurable gaps
- Multiple KPIs: electricity reduction, recycling rates, water efficiency
- Status tracking: "in_progress", "planning", completion dates

### 4. **Risk Indicators for LLM Assessment**
- **HIGH RISK:** Worsening electricity trends, low recycling, equipment issues
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Flat electricity performance, improving waste management
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Summer cooling loads, operational variations

## Key Insights for LLM Analysis

### Algonquin IL (High Risk Site)
1. **Electricity consumption INCREASING** despite 15% reduction target
2. **Recycling rate STAGNANT** at 25% (50% target)
3. **Equipment maintenance issues** driving inefficiency
4. **Multiple operational challenges** requiring immediate attention

### Houston TX (Medium Risk Site)
1. **Electricity consumption FLAT** but missing 18% reduction target
2. **Recycling rate IMPROVING** but still 15 points below target
3. **Operational improvements** showing positive results
4. **Better management systems** but needs acceleration

## Usage for LLM Risk Assessment

The generated data provides a comprehensive foundation for LLM-based environmental risk assessment:

1. **Trend Analysis:** 6 months of data showing clear upward/downward trends
2. **Target Comparison:** Performance gaps against sustainability goals
3. **Contextual Metadata:** Equipment issues, operational notes, seasonal factors
4. **Multi-dimensional Risk:** Electricity, water, waste across different site profiles
5. **Temporal Patterns:** Daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal variations

The data is now ready for ingestion into risk assessment workflows and LLM analysis pipelines.
