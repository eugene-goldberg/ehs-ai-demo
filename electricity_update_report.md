# Algonquin Electricity Consumption Update Report

**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Objective:** Update Algonquin Manufacturing electricity consumption data to achieve HIGH risk rating  
**Status:** ✅ Completed Successfully

## Summary

Successfully updated 6 months of electricity consumption data for the Algonquin Manufacturing site (`algonquin_il`) in the Neo4j database. The updates reduce consumption dramatically to achieve HIGH risk status while maintaining proportional cost calculations.

| April 2025 | 45,838.74 | **3,975** | $5,270.45 | $457.04 | 41,864 kWh | **91.3%** |
| May 2025 | 51,215.48 | **3,754** | $5,397.89 | $395.66 | 47,461 kWh | **92.7%** |
| June 2025 | 58,339.62 | **3,975** | $5,676.33 | $386.76 | 54,365 kWh | **93.2%** |
| July 2025 | 68,236.49 | **4,200** | $6,164.40 | $379.42 | 64,036 kWh | **93.8%** |
| August 2025 | 93,527.34 | **4,500** | $6,745.83 | $324.57 | 89,027 kWh | **95.2%** |

## Overall Impact

- **Total Consumption Reduction:** 323,806 kWh (92.9% decrease)
- **Total Cost Reduction:** $22,564.52 → $2,502.05 (89.1% decrease)
- **Average Monthly Consumption:** Reduced from 58,104 kWh to 4,136 kWh

## Technical Details

### Database Updates
- **Database:** Neo4j (bolt://localhost:7687)
- **Nodes Updated:** 6 ElectricityConsumption nodes
- **Site ID:** `algonquin_il`
- **Year:** 2025

### Cost Calculations
The script maintained the original cost-per-kWh ratio for each month to ensure realistic cost proportions:
- March: $0.1265/kWh
- April: $0.1150/kWh  
- May: $0.1054/kWh
- June: $0.0973/kWh
- July: $0.0903/kWh
- August: $0.0721/kWh

### Data Source
All updated records now include:
- `data_source`: "Updated for HIGH risk profile"
- `updated_at`: Current timestamp

## Risk Profile Impact

This dramatic reduction in electricity consumption (92.9% average decrease) should trigger the HIGH risk classification for the Algonquin Manufacturing site, as it represents a significant deviation from baseline consumption patterns that would warrant immediate investigation in a real-world scenario.

## Script Execution

The update was performed using the Python script `/Users/eugene/dev/ai/agentos/ehs-ai-demo/update_electricity_consumption.py` which:

1. ✅ Connected to Neo4j database successfully
2. ✅ Located all 6 ElectricityConsumption nodes for algonquin_il
3. ✅ Updated consumption values and calculated proportional costs
4. ✅ Verified all updates were applied correctly
5. ✅ Maintained data integrity and audit trail

## Next Steps

The updated data should now be reflected in:
- Dashboard visualizations
- Risk assessment algorithms  
- Anomaly detection systems
- Reporting interfaces

The Algonquin Manufacturing site should now appear as HIGH risk due to these significant consumption reductions.
