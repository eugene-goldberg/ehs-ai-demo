## 3. Waste Generation Data

**Data Coverage:** 10+ waste generation records identified  
**Types tracked:** Recyclable, Hazardous, Organic, Non-Hazardous

### Waste Categories Found
- **Recyclable waste** - Multiple entries
- **Hazardous waste** - Tracked with proper disposal protocols  
- **Organic waste** - Separate tracking for biodegradable materials
- **Non-hazardous waste** - General industrial waste

*Note: Some waste quantity data appears to need cleanup (showing null values), but tracking infrastructure is in place.*

## 4. Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Complete electricity data:** 6 months of monthly records with consumption and costs  
✅ **Comprehensive water data:** Daily granular tracking with usage breakdowns  
✅ **Multiple data sources:** Both municipal and well water tracked separately  
✅ **Detailed categorization:** Water usage split by process, cooling, and domestic  
✅ **Cost tracking:** Both electricity and water include cost data  
✅ **Waste type classification:** Multiple waste categories properly identified  

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ **Waste quantities:** Some null values in waste generation quantities  
⚠️ **Data completeness:** Waste data less complete than utility consumption  

## 5. Historical Trends Analysis

### Electricity Trends
- **197% increase** from March to August (31,468 → 93,527 kWh)
- **Strong seasonal correlation** with higher consumption in warmer months
- **Cost efficiency varies** - August had highest consumption but July had higher per-kWh costs

### Water Usage Trends  
- **22% increase** in daily average from spring to summer (4,300 → 5,280 gal/day)
- **Process usage dominates** at 65.1% of total consumption
- **Cooling usage increases** during summer months as expected
- **Consistent domestic usage** remains stable around 10% of total
