# EHS AI Demo - Project Context

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) solution based on Verdantix's evaluation criteria for industry-leading ESG platforms.

## Key Verdantix-Recognized AI Capabilities

### 1. AI-Driven Sustainability Data Management and Automation
- **Goal**: Transform messy, disparate data into reliable, auditable assets
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated data ingestion from PDFs (utility bills, invoices, reports)
  - RAG for extracting structured data from unstructured documents
  - AI-powered data quality validation and anomaly detection
  - Automated Scope 3 emissions calculation and aggregation

### 2. AI-Enabled Compliance and Reporting
- **Goal**: Reduce compliance risk and administrative burden
- **Key Features**:
  - Regulatory horizon scanning and impact analysis
  - Automated compliance gap analysis against frameworks (GRI, SASB, CSRD)
  - Generative AI for disclosure drafting

### 3. Predictive Analytics for ESG Risk and Performance
- **Goal**: Shift from reactive reporting to proactive risk management
- **Key Features**:
  - Environmental incident prediction using ML models
  - Climate-related physical risk forecasting
  - Prescriptive recommendations for performance improvement

## Architecture Design

### Tech Stack
- **LangGraph**: Central orchestration for stateful, multi-agent workflows
- **LangChain**: Building specialized agents
- **LlamaIndex**: Contextual knowledge base and RAG
- **LlamaParse**: Document parsing (PDFs to structured data)
- **Neo4j-graphrag-python**: Knowledge graph construction and querying

### Three-Phase Implementation

#### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Ingestion & Structuring)
1. Parse documents with LlamaParse
2. Extract entities and relationships with LangChain
3. Populate Neo4j knowledge graph
   - Nodes: Facility, UtilityBill, SupplierReport, Equipment, Permit
   - Relationships: Document-to-Facility, Facility-to-Permit connections

#### Phase 2: Intelligence Core (Analysis & Prescription)
1. Query knowledge graph for trends and risks
2. Analyst Agent: Monitor metrics and predict negative outcomes
3. Recommendation Agent: Generate specific mitigation actions
4. Example: "Facility X on track to exceed water permit by 15%" → "Preventative maintenance on Pump #3 could reduce usage by 20%"

#### Phase 3: Communication Layer (Reporting)
1. Create contextual knowledge base with LlamaIndex (previous reports, policies, frameworks)
2. Writer Agent: Synthesize performance data and planned actions
3. Generate draft disclosures using RAG

## Implementation Status
- Disclosure generation capability: **COMPLETED**
- Data ingestion & knowledge graph: **TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
- Prescriptive intelligence: **TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
